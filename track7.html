    <h1>Description</h1>

    <div class="description">
        <p>This track opens with a peaceful flute tone that is then covered by Matt Van's vocals. Drums begin shortly after, and Van then brings us all into the drop, where his vocals are layered heavily with effects. The drums, synths, and bass sounds in the drop create a feeling of conflict or chaos, this chaotic feeling only being compounded when Van's vocals are chopped into pieces by Galdo during the second part of this section.</p>
        <p>The bridge serves a stark contrast to this, having very little going on apart from the flute and a few percussive hits. The track begins to feel like an argument Van is having with himself, with calm interludes where he defends himself, and chaotic instrumental breakdowns where he screams about his unhappiness.</p>
        <p>The second drop begins with a pitched down version of the lead, and then continues alternating between high and low pitches. This song is a wonderful expression of internal conflict, brought to life by Van's beautiful performance and Galdo's expert production.</p>

    <h1>Lyrics</h1>

    <div class="lyrics">
    <p>Mind's eye's bleeding again, you're in my head</p>
    <p>Hindsight screaming again, you're in my head</p>
    <p>But you failed to notice</p>
    <p>I'm not, not in a place you call a pessimist paradise</p>
    <p>I'm already broken, broken down</p>
    <p>I'm paralyzed, paralyzed, paralyzed</p>
    <p>Oh</p>
    <p>I'm not satisfied, I'm not satisfied</p>
    <p>I'm not satisfied, I'm not satisfied</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>And my blind side, reads between the lines</p>
    <p>Every sacrifice yields expectations for the next time, and I don't mind</p>
    <p>But i'm not satisfied, and I'm not satisfied</p>
    <p>Oh</p>
    <p><i>I'm not satisfied</i></p>
    <p><i>I'm not satisfied</i></p>
    <p>I'm not satisfied, <i>I'm not satisfied</i></p>
    <p>I'm not satisfied</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Satisfied</p>
    <p>Satisfied</p>
    </div>
