    <div class="description">
        <p>If Mr. Fijiwiji were to have a magnum opus, it would be Let the Sky Fall Down ft. Matt Van.</p>
        <p>This track begins uneventfully, similar to all the rest. A piano plays chords in the background and we are introduced to the track's vocalist, Matt Van, but shortly, after only one line, Van's vocals are layered on top of one another so beautifully if you pay attention to it, that you know something spectacular is approaching.</p>
        <p>As soon as Van sings his final line of the first verse, we are introduced to the main arpeggio pattern for this track, a vastly different paced sound to the rest of this album. The sound itself is the perfect hybrid between a chopped vocal and a synth, making it impossible to determine which it even was to begin with.</p>
        <p>Following this first segment, the sound is layered upon itself multiple times, and given a small amount of delay, creating an experience I will not even attempt to describe.</p>
        <p>The arpeggios slowly fade, and we are brought delicately by piano into the second verse.</p>
        <p>Van's vocals begin the same, but quickly gain the layers this song so beautifully employs. His performance of the lines "Blue turns into gray, and my heart betrayed/All I can do is wait, hoping the ash will fade" is the best he has ever released.</p>
        <p>Where we would previously expect the drop to begin, instead Van simply hums over empty space that is slowly filled by a new sound, a synth so huge and forward that it cannot be ignored. It builds gradually until the drums come in, and it repeats, enveloping the listener fully into the narrative of this track. A choppy, higher-pitched sound then arrives on top of a quieter version of that giant synth, taking us out of this section.</p>
        <p>The main arpeggio returns, but as almost a calm element now. This segment, through contrast, helps the listener realize how far that track developed over its course. It is so engagins as it builds that without a slower section from the beginning the effect may be lost on the listener.</p>

    <div class="lyrics">
        <p>Let the sky fall down, can you feel me now?</p>
        <p>Locked with these memories about you, somebody let me out</p>
        <p>Let the sky fall down, can you hear me now?</p>
        <p>I can't feel anything without you, so let the sky fall down</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Let the sky fall down, like a mushroom cloud</p>
        <p>I'm losing everything I've found as the sky falls down</p>
        <p>Blue turns into gray, and my heart betrayed</p>
        <p>All I can do is wait, hoping the ash will fade</p>
        <p>Let the sky fall down, no-oh, let the sky fall down</p>
        <p>Let the sky fall down</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Let the sky fall, the sky fall, the sky fall, the sky fall down</p>
        <p>Let the sky fall down, down, down, down, down</p>
