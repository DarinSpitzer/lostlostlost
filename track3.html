    <div class="description">
        <p>Track three opens with the same modified piano that was so prevalent in Reality is More Beautiful. The female vocal lead from the first track returns on the third, with her own lyrics, and a segment where Galdo chops her vocals into almost a new instrument.</p>
        <p>The first half of the song lacks those emotional synths that Galdo never ceases to draw us in with, but in the very middle of the track they make a brilliant return in absence of any other sounds.</p>

        <p>You've got me out of my mind</p> 
        <p>These feelings I have can be defined</p> 
        <p>I don't know what I don't want</p> 
        <p>But I know i need you</p> 
        <p>Holding on for dear life, give me something to hold onto</p> 
        <p>I don't know how i feel, but I know I need you...</p> 
        <p>To give me something to hold onto</p> 
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Tell me how am I supposed to know</p> 
        <p>When these feelings you have cannot show</p> 
        <p>I don't know what I don't want</p> 
        <p>But I know i need you</p> 
        <p>Holding on for dear life, give me something to hold onto</p> 
        <p>I don't know how i feel, but I know I need you...</p> 
        <p>To give me something to hold onto</p>
