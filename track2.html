        <h1>Description</h1>

        <div class="description">
                <p>Track two, Reality is More Beautiful, begins with plucky piano/harp melody, and Matt Van's signature vocals begin. This leads into a violin segment to build tension, and as is to be expected, the song reaches its first climax with a captivating lead from Matt Van combined with a dense synth pattern from Galdo.
                </p>
                <p>This mass of violin, piano, harp, synth, vocals, and pitched down vocal tones combine to create a truly beautiful piece of music.</p>
                <p>In the track, Van describes the relationship between dreams and reality. His main statement is that, as long as he loves someone, reality is better than even dreams. He reiterates this sentiment with the line "I don't wanna live in my mind, Get me out of this prison and into the daylight" soildifying the overall theme of this track.</p>
                <p>There is also a sad hint in the line "why can't you love someone like me" implying that this love he feels is unrequited, and he would rather just feel it than live in his dreams.</p>
