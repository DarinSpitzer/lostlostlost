    <h1>Description</h1>
    
    <div class="description">
        <p>This track is a collaboration between Mr. Fijiwiji and his producer/friend/frequent collaborator Exist Strategy, whose expertise in creating ambient music helps develop a very well-established atmosphere.</p>
        <p>Despite beginning with the same static sound that all others fade in with, this track immediately distinguishes itself from the rest of the songs with its choice in instruments. A percussive chime tone, layered with a heavily altered guitar and vocal tones creates a chilling atmosphere. After a small buildup, an enormous rumble emerges with light arpeggios playing behind it. Finally, the lead kicks in, and it is a huge horn.</p> <p>These sounds all layer upon one another, never cancelling eachother out until the end of the first section, where the process begins anew, except with dark piano chords instead of the guitar. The second section also employs more varied percussion, and the occasional echo effect on the soft arpeggios.<p></p>
